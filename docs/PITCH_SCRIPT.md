# Pitch Script (60 Seconds)

**0:00 - 0:10 (Problem)**
"Hi, we're Team Antigravity. We know that Retail Media is booming, but production is hitting a wall. To run a truly personalized beauty campaign today, you need hundreds of variations—different skin tones, ages, and formats. Photoshoots just can't keep up."

**0:10 - 0:30 (Solution)**
"Introducing **TABCE**—the Tesco AI Beauty Creative Engine. TABCE is a generative content platform that turns a *single* product packshot into infinite, diverse, and brand-compliant creatives. It's not just a resizer; it's a full-stack production studio."

**0:30 - 0:45 (How it works)**
"Our engine inputs a product, generates a 3D face mesh, creates synthetic models representing our diverse customer base, applies virtual makeup styles like 'Indian Bridal' or 'Western Nude', and auto-composes them into Tesco-standard web and social banners."

**0:45 - 0:60 (Impact)**
"We even score them for predicted CTR before they go live. With TABCE, we're cutting production time from weeks to minutes, ensuring every Tesco customer sees a face that looks like them. Thank you."
